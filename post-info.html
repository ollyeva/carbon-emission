        <i><b>The carbon eMISSION</b></i> was an experimental project undertaken
        to expose the carbon footprints of regularly used media platforms. It
        uses data input from the viewer and calculates in real-time the carbon
        equivalent produced by each platform. <br /><br />
        What is the materiality of computing? This is often a question
        overlooked as technology holds an appearance of being ‘weightless’. I
        have spent many hours considering this and examining the different
        factors that make up the internet from cables under seas to large-scale
        factories producing our everyday machines. How can the internet be so
        hidden and misunderstood in a physical sense? This experiment was
        created to reveal the connection that the internet has on workers and
        the environment.
        <br /><br />
        The internet today produces 4% of the worlds global carbon emissions,
        exceeding the aviation industry

        predicted to grow by 53% in 2021

        usage, calculating the equivalent carbon emissions required to meet
        their requests

        >. <br /><br />
        This project revealed the nature of websites, where they can be improved
        and the drawbacks of platforms. Streaming services and communication
        such as emails had the biggest carbon footprints

        As the internet is so ‘unseeable’, there are many sets of factors
        involved in the operation and running of the internet. It is impossible
        to exactly determine the number of carbon emissions for each platform
        thus the figures are an approximation. The Carbon eMISSION is designed
        to act as communicative medium to expose the impact of technology on the
        physical world.
        <br /><br />
        It is not all doom and gloom however, there are many ways in which the
        world is improving our online carbon footprint, mainly through renewable
        energies in data servers
        <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8w3_gcMw0I" target="_blank">[6]</a>.
        We can also make a difference as individuals. According to recent
        studies, the design of a website plays a large role in the carbon
        footprint, attributing to 40%. The sustainability of the internet begins
        here for designers

        The impact this project hopes to explore is for the viewer to
        re-evaluate their everyday usage of technology and have a greater
        understanding of the actions and consequences, and invite the audience
        to think critically of technology in a broader sense outside of their
        perceivable world.
