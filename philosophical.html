      <h1>The Carbon eMission: Further Reflections</h1>
      <p>
        This project brought to light many issues surrounding the use of the
        internet. For example, 129 internet searches were made for this project,
        with a carbon footprint of their own. Whilst I preach for better
        behaviour around this, I am actively producing my own carbon emissions
        through the very interface I try to stray from. This is contradiction I
        cannot ignore, am I any better? How can we reduce our online carbon
        footprint when we live in a society so dependent on technology? There
        are ways, as a designer I can make a change. By improving the efficiency
        of websites and limiting the content amount we can make a change in the
        amount of carbon produced for each website on average. That is the sole
        reason this website has no styling, no images, no videos, and only
        internal Javascript. The less loading the better.
        <br /><br />
        For example, YouTube can improve the performance of their website by
        halting video playback when the site is tabbed out, “If 25% of music
        videos are played in the background of a user’s browser, then YouTube
        could save 323,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent [annually]”,

        a small change with large benefits. Was this project worth the price
        payed to create? I believe so. The effort and research were a small
        price if more people understand the internet better and make personal
        changes in their behaviour. Ultimately, the internet will always be
        doing more good than harm, with online platforms replacing hard copy
        processes that produce more carbon dioxide than their online equivalent.
        The project has highlighted one important matter, that no one process
        should be left unchecked in the fight against carbon inefficiency.
